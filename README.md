*krushimitra_simulation*
🌾 Key Features:
3D Paddy Field Environment:

Realistic flooded paddy field with 100 rice plants in traditional rows
Water level simulation (6cm depth as mentioned in your specs)
Mud/soil base texture

KrushiMitra Robot Design:

Green body representing your bamboo frame design
Black camera module (Redmi 9A representation)
Orange treatment arm with nano-emulsion delivery
4 amphibious treads (repurposed scooter tires)
Solar panel on top

Disease Detection & Treatment:

Real-time disease detection (Rice Blast, Brown Spot, Bacterial Blight)
Visual alerts when diseases are found
Automated treatment application with success indicators
Color changes from diseased (brown/yellow) to healthy (green)

Interactive Controls:

Start/Stop: Toggle robot movement
Reset Field: Restart simulation with new disease distribution
Add Disease: Manually add diseases for testing

Live Statistics:

Healthy vs diseased plant counts
Treatment success rate
Cost savings calculation (₹150 per plant saved)
Battery level indicator
Your actual BOM cost (₹18,700) and ROI period (14 months)

Cultural Elements:

Odia text: "Machhi ra jatra jibe pani re"
Robot moves at 0.5 km/h (livestock-safe speed)
Zigzag movement pattern like traditional farming

🚀 Technical Highlights:

Robot follows realistic field navigation patterns
Disease detection happens within 1.5m of proximity
Treatment takes 2 seconds (realistic nano-emulsion application)
90% chemical reduction visualization
Festival calendar integration ready (expandable)

This simulation demonstrates our key innovation: early disease detection and precision treatment that saves crops before 40% loss occurs, just like our field surveys in Bargarh district 
showed!

🚀 How to Test:

Load the page - You should see the green robot in the field
Click "Start/Stop" - Robot should begin moving in zigzag pattern
Check console - You'll see debug messages showing robot position and status
Try other buttons - All functions should work without errors

🎯 What You Should See:

Green robot with black camera, orange arm, dark treads, blue solar panel
100 rice plants arranged in 10x10 grid
Flooded field with animated water
Working controls with no JavaScript errors

The robot should now be fully visible and functional! Click the "Start/Stop" button to see our KrushiMitra robot begin its field scanning mission. 🤖🌾
